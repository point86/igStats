 # igStats
A command-line utility written in Python that connects to your Instagram account, and retrieve the list of profiles that you are following and the list of profiles that are following you.
It will then display a report that shows:
- list of profiles that you are following and they aren't following you back (Following - Followers).
- list of profiles that are following you and you aren't following them back (Followers - Following).

## Requirements
- Firefox web browser (version â‰¥60).
- Geckodriver (downloadable via https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).
- Python 3.x
With additional packages (downloadable with pip):
-- Selenium
-- BeautifulSoup

## Usage

First you need to create a configuation file named `igStats.ini` and place it in the same directory as this script.
```ini
[settings]
Instagram Profile = <your Instagram profile name>
Firefox Profile = <path to your Firefox profile>
Dump Followers  = <Yes|No>
```
Firefox profile's path can be found by typing `about:profiles` in your Firefox's search bar. You can leave that variable blank, but then you will need to perform log-in every time you will use this program.
Then you have 2 options, you can run `igStats.py` or `igStatsBrowser.py`. The only difference between them is that the latter will present you two pretty printed HTML files, instead of a simple text output.

### igStats
This is the fastest program, it shows you a text based output on the command line.
```bash
$ python3 igStats.py
```
### igStatsBrowser
```bash
$ python3 igStatsBrowser.py
```
This is slower because it will also download all profiles images that are involved, and it will present a pretty printed HTML output.
It will generate two HTML files, `fwing-fwers.html` and `fwers-fwing.html` which respectively contains *"Following - Followers"* and *"Followers - Following"* lists.

### igDiff
```bash
$ python3 igDiff.py followers_xxx.pkl followers_yyy.pkl
```
It will show you the difference between two dumps of your Instagram followers list. (Dumps must be previously generated with igStats.py or igStatsBrowser.py .

## Disclaimer
Although this program doesn't let you modify your Instagram's followers/following lists, it can be seen as a bot and your Instagram profile can be disabled. Use it at your own risk!
